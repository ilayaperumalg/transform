= Transform Processor

Use the transform app in a stream to convert a Message's content or structure.

The transform processor is used by passing a SpEL expression. The expression should return the modified message or payload. 

As part of the SpEL expression you can make use of the pre-registered JSON Path function. The syntax is #jsonPath(payload,'<json path expression>')

//end::ref-doc[]
== Build

You can find the corresponding binder based projects here.
You can then cd into one one of the folders and build it:
